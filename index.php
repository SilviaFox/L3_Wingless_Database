            <p>I can't stop partying, partying
I can't stop partying, partying
I gotta have Patrón, I gotta have the beat
I gotta have a lot of pretty girls around me
Oh, I can't stop partying, partying
I can't stop, partying, partying
I gotta have the cars, I gotta have the jewels
And if you was me, honey, you would do it too
Monday to Sunday I hit all the clubs
And now e'rybody know me when I pull up
I got the real big posse with me, yeah I'm deep
And if you lookin' for me I'm in VIP
Just follow the smoke, they're bringing bottles of the Goose

No sleep, no sleep, I am always on a mission cause
I can't stop partying, partying
I can't stop partying, partying
I gotta have Patrón, I gotta have the
